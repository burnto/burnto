## Hi, I'm Brent! 🤘

🐣 I incubate enterprise payments tech at PayPal. Mostly this means I help create teams, forums, and opportunities for teams to surface and play with new ideas based on discovery of customer and merchant businesses and needs. 

In past work I designed and wrote mobile payments SDKs used in major e-commerce native apps, helped pioneer novel user interfaces, dropped into M+A processes to assess and level teams, and ran programs to promote creative learning and growth for engineers at all levels. In my grad school days I presented work to the MIT community, at conferences like AIGA and CHI, and was sponsored to speak to audiences at international technology companies.
